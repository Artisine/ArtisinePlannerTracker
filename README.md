# Artisine PlannerTracker

This is my AQA A-Level Computer Science personal project (NEA).
It's a cross-platform app, available on mobile, tablet, desktop, etc, based on the Progressive Web App workflow.
It's purpose is to serve as a notepad, calendar, alarms/reminders, scheduler, all in the same place.
Because these functions are housed in the same place, they can be tightly integrated with each other.
Example, I write a note for homework in notes section, adding a due date, this due date will appear in the calendar and the user may set a reminder/alarm to send a push notification (mobile only) before the relevant time-date.
It'll use a backend database to manage data persistence between user-devices, and manage user account authentication.
Backend server scripts written in javascript/NodeJS? Perhaps insecure, but for this project, time is of the essence.
Will be focus-testing on fellow students to see potential improvements to make.
