  "description": "This is my AQA A-Level Computer Science personal project (NEA).\r It's a cross-platform app, available on mobile, tablet, desktop, etc, based on the Progressive Web App workflow.\r It's purpose is to serve as a notepad, calendar, alarms/reminders, scheduler, all in the same place.\r Because these functions are housed in the same place, they can be tightly integrated with each other.\r Example, I write a note for homework in notes section, adding a due date, this due date will appear in the calendar and the user may set a reminder/alarm to send a push notification (mobile only) before the relevant time-date.\r It'll use a backend database to manage data persistence between user-devices, and manage user account authentication.\r Backend server scripts written in javascript/NodeJS? Perhaps insecure, but for this project, time is of the essence.\r Will be focus-testing on fellow students to see potential improvements to make.",
